# gitting_good
first steps at getting good at git aka hello-world
also could be a text space for share ideas
I'm 28 years old and still can't decide what I want to do for a living
(currently do system administration on a small local company - not sure that it is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Also, salary is kinda OK but I can not allow myself to buy all the cool stuff I REALLY wanted, like VR-helmet, or I can't even buy myself a decent pair of shoes or jeans every time I need one)
