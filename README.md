# gitting_good
first steps at getting good at git aka hello-world
also could be a text space for share ideas
I'm a 28 years old and still can't decide what i wan't to do for living
(currently do system adminstration on a small local company - not sure that it is what i want to do for the rest of my life. Also salary is kinda OK but i can not allow myself to by all the cool stuff i REALLY wanted, like VR-helmet, or i can't even buy myself a decent pair of shoes or jeans every time i need one)
